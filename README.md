## 🔍 **How Does It Work?**  
Here’s the journey of how we built this amazing tool:

### 1. **Data Collection & Extraction**  
We scoured Analytics Vidhya’s platform, collecting critical data such as:
- **Course Titles**  
- **Descriptions**  
- **Curriculum Breakdown**  

Using APIs and web scraping techniques, we compiled this information to form a comprehensive dataset.

### 2. **Embedding & Search Setup**  
- **Embeddings**: We used **Sentence Transformers** to create semantic embeddings of course titles and descriptions.  
- **Vector Database**: We stored these embeddings in **Pinecone** to enable fast and efficient retrieval.  
- **RAG Model**: Leveraging **LangChain (0.3.x)**, we created a Retriever-Generated Answer system that fetches the most relevant results based on cosine similarity between user queries and course embeddings.

### 3. **Deployment on Huggingface Spaces**  
- **Framework**: We built a sleek, interactive interface using **Streamlit** to ensure smooth user experience.  
- **Deployment**: The tool is live and accessible via [Huggingface Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/smart-search-vidhya-courses) for public use.

## 🎨 **Features & Functionality**  
Here’s what makes our tool shine:  
- **Natural Language Querying**: Type your query in everyday language, and our tool understands your intent.  
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Get the top 5 relevant course recommendations instantly.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Sleek design, smooth navigation, and a responsive layout, making your search effortless and enjoyable.

## 💡 **Key Libraries & Tools Used**  
- **Sentence Transformers**: For embedding course data into vector representations.  
- **LangChain**: To build and manage the RAG (Retriever-Generated Answer) system.  
- **Pinecone**: A vector database for storing and retrieving course embeddings efficiently.  
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface and deploying on Huggingface Spaces.

## 📝 **Methodology & Approach**  
### **Why LangChain & LlamaIndex?**  
We chose **LangChain 0.3.x** because of its powerful tools for building RAG systems that seamlessly integrate with vector databases like Pinecone. We utilized the **MiniLM model** for embedding, ensuring a balance between accuracy and efficiency.

### **Evaluation & Results**  
- **Precision & Recall**: Our search system consistently delivers relevant course suggestions, reducing search time by 70-80%.  
- **User Feedback**: Based on early feedback, we fine-tuned the RAG model, improving relevance and accuracy.
